Several solutions can address this issue:

1. **Verify the Document Path:** Double-check that the path used in `doc(db, "cities", "BJ")` exactly matches the path of the document in Firestore.  Case sensitivity is crucial.

2. **Check Firestore Security Rules:** Ensure your Firestore security rules allow read access for the user or service account attempting to retrieve the document.  If the rules are too restrictive, the getDoc() method will fail.

3. **Data Consistency:** Verify that the data has been written to Firestore successfully. It may take a short time to propagate. If your document is recently added, wait a few seconds before attempting to retrieve it.

4. **Debug with Firestore Console:** Use the Firestore console to manually verify that the document exists at the specified path and that it contains the expected data.

5. **Use `onSnapshot` for Real-Time Updates:** If you need real-time updates, consider using `onSnapshot` instead of `getDoc()`, which provides a more responsive approach to changes in Firestore.

**Example using onSnapshot (Solution):**

```javascript
import { onSnapshot, doc, getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

const db = getFirestore();
const docRef = doc(db, "cities", "BJ");

const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(docRef, (doc) => {
  if (doc.exists()) {
    console.log("Document data:", doc.data());
  } else {
    console.log("No such document!");
  }
}, (error) => {
  console.error("Error getting document:", error);
});

//Remember to unsubscribe when finished with the listener
//unsubscribe();
```
